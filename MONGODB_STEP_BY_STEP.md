# üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Atlas - Step by Step Guide

## üìã **Complete MongoDB Setup (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Go to Your MongoDB Atlas Dashboard**
1. **Open this link**: https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/6673d5b56e8fde266a74b7d7#/settings/groupSettings
2. **You should see your cluster dashboard**

### **Step 2: Create Database User**
1. **Click "Database Access"** (left sidebar)
2. **Click "Add New Database User"**
3. **Fill in the form**:
   - **Username**: `moody-player-user`
   - **Password**: Click "Autogenerate Secure Password" (SAVE THIS PASSWORD!)
   - **Database User Privileges**: Select "Read and write to any database"
4. **Click "Add User"**

### **Step 3: Allow Network Access**
1. **Click "Network Access"** (left sidebar)
2. **Click "Add IP Address"**
3. **Click "Allow access from anywhere"** (for development)

### **Step 5: Update Connection String**
Your connection string will look like:

**Replace:**
- `<username>` with `moody-player-user`
- `<password>` with the password you saved in Step 2
- Add `/moody-player` before the `?` for database name
