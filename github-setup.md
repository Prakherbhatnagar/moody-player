# ðŸš€ GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `moody-player`
3. Description: `AI-powered music application with mood detection and Spotify integration`
4. Make it **Public** (required for Vercel)
5. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Get Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the repository URL. It will look like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/moody-player.git
```

## Step 3: Add Remote and Push

Run these commands in your terminal (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/moody-player.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. The repository should show 26+ files

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub, we'll deploy to Vercel using the GitHub integration!
